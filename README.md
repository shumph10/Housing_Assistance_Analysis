# Housing Assistance Analysis
# Final-Project 
------------------------------ 
## Overview**  

	Our project focuses on affordable housing vouchers' strain on governmental assistance programs as rent prices for many across the United States skyrockets. This analysis will use data from the US Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) to establish the fair market price for two-bedroom houses in 2017 and 2022. The figure primarily specifies the amount of governmental assistance awarded by subtracting income-based recipient payments. HUD describes fair housing prices as below 30% of total household income, requiring that participants in either Section 8 (general housing assistance) or Section 202 (elderly housing assistance) pay a minimum 30% adjusted monthly income towards rent. The rest of the rent is the responsibility of the HUD voucher program. Low-income thresholds (those eligible for assistance) will be established, corresponding by the county to determine the typical rent paid by assistance recipients in that area for both years.  

	The hypothesis is that while incomes have remained similar between years, rent prices have increased in many areas drastically, putting significant strain on governmental assistance programs to make the difference as recipients have a maximum threshold set by income. The aim is to determine the government payout difference and use a machine learning model to determine clusters of areas with a more significant voucher payout increase and what factors have the most effective weight in this increase. The alternative hypothesis is that there is no correlation between increased rent and government assistance program payout in 2017 and 2022.  

	The years 2017  and 2022 were selected to examine rent increases in the wake of the influence of the COVID-19 pandemic. As supply-chain issues ensued, many jobs were lost or suspended for extended periods. A temporary halt in residential evictions left landlords attempting to recoup profit, and rent in many areas of the United States has increased; A year before the pandemic (2017) and after the pandemic (2022) were chosen for the best possible representation of changes. While our project will attempt to analyze the changes in governmental housing assistance programs, this is important to note as it significantly influences the rent increase the HUD assistance programs will need to cover.

Pre vs. post-pandemic has the strain on governmental programs to cover the gap in rent prices increased as rent prices have potentially increased as well. 


## Data Sources** 

Our data was sourced from the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development as it offers the most up-to-date information on fair market rents, section 8 & 202 housing vouchers, and guidelines for determining the amount of assistance and qualification. 

Additionally, this department gathers information to advise changes in payout standards for the Housing Choice Voucher program. As a government-run department, data from this source should be plentiful and contain minimal bias.

## Questions We Hope to Answer with the Data** 

1) What is considered a fair market price to the HUD? 

  - This will aid in establishing the baseline for HUD requirement for housing assistance voucher amounts, as it is their major contributing factor. 

2) What areas have increased the most housing voucher assistance payouts and rent over the years? 

  - This will establish areas where the strain on governmental assistance programs will be the highest. 

  - Machine learning model will establish clusters based on the increase. 

  - Information from these models will be used to conclude factors influencing the increase.

## Communication Protocols** 

Primary communication will occur through a designated slack channel; additional contacts have been shared for email and text communication if needed. At least two team sessions will occur weekly, with other sessions for progress completion.  

Another team member will review and approve pull requests to ensure best practices and progression.
